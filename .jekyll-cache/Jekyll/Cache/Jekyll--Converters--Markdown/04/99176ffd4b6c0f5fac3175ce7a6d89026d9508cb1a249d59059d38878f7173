<p>The following are guidelines for submitting documentation to the Voron Community documentation repo.  This is to provide a consistent format for the resulting documentation and information.</p>

<h2 id="all-submissions">All submissions</h2>

<p>All submissions must include the following content in the header of any templated files to be rendered.  Any submissions missing this header may be rejected.</p>

<!--  -->
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: default
title: &lt;title&gt;
nav_exclude: true
---
</code></pre></div></div>
<!--  -->

<h2 id="howto-guides-troubleshooting-alternate-electronics">Howto Guides, Troubleshooting, Alternate Electronics</h2>

<p>Each submitter should create a directory for their user.  The directory name should preferably be the same as their Discord username or Github username.  Each guide should be named accordingly but include the markdown “.md” extension (e.g. ‘how_to_build_voron.md’).  If there are images to be included, it is recommended to create an ‘images’ subdirectory for all of the images and link to those in the guide.</p>

<p>Each pull request should also update the associated base index.md with a link to the guide itself and the creator’s username.</p>

<h2 id="macros">Macros</h2>

<p>Each submitter should create a macro file in the ‘macros’ subdirectory.<br />
That file should preferably be the same as their Discord username or Github username.</p>

<p>Each pull request should also update the associated index.md with a link to the macro and the creator’s username.</p>
