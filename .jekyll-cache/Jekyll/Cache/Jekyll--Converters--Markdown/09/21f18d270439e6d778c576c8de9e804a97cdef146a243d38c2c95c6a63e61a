<h4 id="retrieve-log-file-octoprint">Retrieve Log File (Octoprint)</h4>

<p>The Klippy log file (/tmp/klippy.log) contains debugging information.
Execute the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M112</code> command in the OctoPrint terminal window immediately after the undesirable event.</p>

<p>There is also a logextract.py script that may be useful when analyzing a micro-controller shutdown or similar problem.  To use it follow this procedure:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir work_directory
cd work_directory
cp /tmp/klippy.log .
~/klipper/scripts/logextract.py ./klippy.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The script will extract the printer config file and MCU shutdown information to work_directory.</p>

<p><em>Mainsail and Fluidd have built-in tools to extract and downlaod the klippy.log.</em></p>

<h4 id="tmc-uart-error">TMC UART Error</h4>

<p>This appears when the communication between the TMC drivers and the MCU is not working. Typically this means that you have not powered the SKR board with 12-24V (TMC drivers didn’t boot), you haven’t plugged in the TMC steppers to the correct spots, or you forgot to add or remove a jumper as detailed above.</p>

<h4 id="adc-error">ADC Error</h4>

<p>ADC stands for “Analog to Digital Converter” and is what is used to convert thermistor readings to temperatures for your hotend and heated bed. As a safety precaution, if Klipper is expecting a thermistor to be plugged in but it is reading an invalid reading (no thermistor = open, or 0 ohms for a shorted wire as closed), it will go in to this shut down mode. Double check to make sure your thermistors are plugged in to the correct boards and plugs.</p>

<h4 id="unable-to-connect">Unable to Connect</h4>

<p>Once the underlying issue is corrected, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FIRMWARE_RESTART</code> command to reset the firmware, reload the config, and restart the host software. Check MCU IDs match your printer.cfg.  <em>Make sure you get the paths right!</em></p>
