<p>This is caused by crappy wiring in your house + the bed heater being on. By default the heater is using a PID algorithm to keep its temperature at the set value â€“ this switches the heater on and off quickly (a bigger VORON has 700W+ mains heater; a 300mm V2 can pull 6-8 Amps at peak load, which can overload a circuit if there is too much else going on), this causes the flicker in your home electrical network.</p>

<p>In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[heater_bed]</code> section make the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If line power is 60Hz, add a line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwm_cycle_time: 0.0166</code></li>
  <li>If line power is 50Hz, add a line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwm_cycle_time: 0.02</code></li>
</ul>
