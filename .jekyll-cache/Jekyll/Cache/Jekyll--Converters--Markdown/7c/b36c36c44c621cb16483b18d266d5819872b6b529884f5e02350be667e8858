<p>Download the â€œvoron_design_cube_v7.stlâ€ from the <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/tree/Voron2.4/STLs/TEST_PRINTS">Voron Github page</a>, and open the file in the chosen slicer. Use the default slicer settings, but make sure the hotend temperature and bed temperature is correct for the filament you are using. A good starting point is 240C hotend temperature, 100C heated bed temperature, and 92% flow for ABS.</p>

<p>Slice the file and save the .gcode file to your desktop (if you havenâ€™t set up the Octoprint Plugin or your slicer, Mainsail and Fluidd do not need plugins). Navigate to Octoprint, Mainsail, or Fluidd in your web browser, and upload the file. Press â€œPrintâ€ and closely watch the beginning of the print. If your nozzle is too far or close to the bed, on your printer display press the knob, navigate to â€œTuneâ€, and adjust the Z offset distance (+ is further from the bed, - is closer).</p>

<p>Once you are printing (with your printer fully assembled), take a quick video, upload it to the Voron subreddit and eat a well deserved bowl of cereal!</p>

<p>Done with your cereal?  The printerâ€™s not not done yet!  There is still lots of adjusting to do so the printer can turn out high speed perfection.</p>
