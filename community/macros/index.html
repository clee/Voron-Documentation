<h1 id="macros">Macros</h1>

<p>Macros are an essential tool for configuring and managing Klipper.  A number of macros are pre-defined in the example configurations but a lot more is possible.</p>

<p>Klipper macros are always in the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[gcode_macro &lt;macro_name&gt;]
gcode:
    &lt;gcode&gt;
    &lt;gcode&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> The tab / spaces before the gcode is required.</p>

<h2 id="required--pre-built">Required / Pre-built</h2>

<p>To see examples of the macros themselves, look at the standard printer.cfg for the printer.</p>

<h3 id="homing-override--safe-z-home">Homing Override / Safe Z Home</h3>

<p>By default, all printers are setup with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[homing_override]</code> configuration section that includes a gcode macro for the home process.  This macro is updating during thee setup process to define the Z endstop location.  However the homing override method always homes X and Y before homing Z.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[safe_z_home]</code> configuration allows for a Z homing process without requiring a repeat home of X and Y.  To enable safe z homing disable homing override and provide a X,Y coordinate of your Z endstop pin.  Be aware that enabling safe Z home will likely require a change in other processes / macros.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position: 175.5,253
z_hop: 5.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="g32">G32</h3>

<p>The G32 macro is included with the stock configuration for most printers.  This is typically used as a “full home” process that will home and perform leveling / tilt adjustments.</p>

<h3 id="print_start">PRINT_START</h3>

<p>The PRINT_START macro is called at the start of every print by slicers that are confgured to be aware of it.</p>

<h3 id="print_end">PRINT_END</h3>

<p>The PRINT_END macro is called at the end of every print by slicers that are configured to be aware of it.</p>
